# miniShad0w #archive
Modular C2 framework created in 2 months.
It has the capabilities of loader with some advance capabilities. 
It is not tested thoroughly and some commands can sometimes lead to crash of the beacon while executingn the commands.
It resurrects itself after crash. 

The server cnc is taken and modified from ``bats3c/shad0w`` and is unstable, prone to bugs. 

I don't have plan to take it further, but to archive it. Pull requests are welcome.
