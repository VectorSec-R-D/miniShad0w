# miniShad0w #archive
Modular C2 framework created in 2 months for windows.
It has the capabilities of loader with some advance capabilities. 
It is not tested thoroughly and some commands can sometimes lead to crash of the beacon while beacon is executing the commands in older windows.
It resurrects itself after crash. 

The server-side command and control is taken and modified from [bats3c/shad0w](https://github.com/bats3c/shad0w) to work with our beacon.
I am also a contributor in that project.

archive it.
