# miniShad0w #archive
Modular C2 framework created in 2 months for windows.
It has the capabilities of loader with some advance capabilities. 
It is not tested thoroughly and some commands can sometimes lead to crash of the beacon while beacon is executing the commands in older windows.
It resurrects itself after crash. 

The server cnc is taken and modified from ``bats3c/shad0w`` and is unstable, prone to bugs. 

archive it. Pull requests are welcome.
